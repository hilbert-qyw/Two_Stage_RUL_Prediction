# Two_Stage_RUL_Prediction

The data could be downloaded from the google drive with a shared link of "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rfPDB7AeBDEtCvJuWGpdLItLehCBYvLw?usp=sharing".

The "CNN_life_pre.py" based on Python is used for the first-stage cycle life prediction of lithium-ion batteries. The "C1_GP_200.m" based on MATLAB is used for the second-stage RUL prediction of lithium-ion batteries.
